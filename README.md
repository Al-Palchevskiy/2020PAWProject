## 1.0 Introduction
The goal of the project is to have a motorized wheelchair that would be controlled in the same was as a manual wheelchair except with push-assist when users input is sensed. Additional torque would be applied to each wheel independently and proportional to users input.

***
## 2.0 Hardware Set-up
There are 4 main componets
2x wheel modules (Teensy 3.6)
1x main controller (Raspberry Pi 3B+)
1x motor controller (Roboteq SBL2360)

### 2.1 Wheel Modules
The main componets of the wheel modules are
1x Teensy 3.6 micro-controller
1x hall effect sensor
1x bluetooth moduel
1x Li-ion battery

The hall effect sensor is used to get users input, T
